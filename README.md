NLP Query Summarizer 

Awarded first prize (Bloomberg Tech Stack Challenge) for our natural language processing application 'Qoi - Questions of Interest' created during HackKings 6.0 that works as a research tool and summariser. The application was written exclusively in Python3 and accepts input from a user either vocally or manually through text, and then isolates the keywords from the query, performs a google search, selects the top articles/pages returned, scrapes the pages for text ignoring unwanted information such as meta data and headers, and finally summarises all text obtained by analysing word frequency and then returns a concise paragraph answering the user's question. APIs and libraries used during this project include spaCy, pocketsphinx, pyaudio, Google search, BeautifulSoup4, lxml, requests, and TkInter.
